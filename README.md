# Basics of Bash Labs
Simple bash and python scripts written for Operating Systems (Systemy Operacyjne 2) course at the university.

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

The last labs (`/Lab6-7/`) was about Python and using Python to manipulate on files. These scripts are in this repo as well.

I don't remember the task descriptions, but it should be pretty straightforward what every script does. I tried my best to make them as easy to understand as possible.

Some of the scripts require additional files on which they operate, some create these files by themselves. Unfortunately I didn't create scripts for creating these files, but put template files in corresponding branches (eg. `lab1-example_files`).
